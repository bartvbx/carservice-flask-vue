# carservice-flask-vue

I created the 'CarService' project as a final assessment for a university course.
The main requirement was to build a single-page application (SPA) using the Vue framework.
There were no restrictions on other technologies, so I picked Flask and SQLite.

Currently, I'm refactoring this project as I see a lot of possible improvements.
Also, the project initially had to be written in Polish.
Now I am changing its language to English.
